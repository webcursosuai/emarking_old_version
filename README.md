Release notes
-------------

1.0.0: First official deploy

NOTE
----

This module was developed starting from Moodle 2.4.x and it is currently used and
developed in Moodle 2.8.x. It does not use any specific code in 2.8.x so
it should be compatible to 2.4+, however we have not tested it.

Introduction
------------

eMarking is a tool for electronically marking paper based exams, which covers
the whole process of producing a personalized exam for printing, automatically
process a scanned exam from a PDF file and upload each exam as a submission for
each student, provides an interface for annotating the PDF which is supported by
Moodle rubrics, supports a regrading workflow for students to request regrades
and tutors or the teacher providing extra feedback.

It also includes some optional features like:
- Anonymous marking (tutors can not see the exam's author)
- Grade reports (some basic reports) based on per criteria performance
- Students can review their feedback through a web based interface or download it in a PDF
- Justice perception allows teachers to ask their students on their perception on how fair
was the evaluation, with some extra visualizations of the student performance

Installation
------------

In order to install eMarking, the emarking directory in which this
README file is should be copied to the /mod/ directory in your Moodle
installation. Then visit your admin page to install the module.
